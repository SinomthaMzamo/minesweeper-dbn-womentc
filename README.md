## Title
tech_wednesdays pilot project: Minesweeper.

## Description
This project is my submission to the "dbn_womenthinkcode_" tech_wednesdays initiative

## Directions
All code files relating to the the game will go inside the directory "game files".
Navigate to "notes_for_discussion" for practice problems and other notes on OOP.
Extra files and guides can be found inside "pdf_guides".

## Notice
Fork the repo. Monitor the main branch for updates as the version on the main branch is what we will be building together.
You are welcome to work on your own solution on your fork.

# Intro
Welcome to Minesweeper, an introductory project designed to explore the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this project, we aim to build the classic Minesweeper game using OOP principles. We'll create classes to represent the fundamental components of the game.
