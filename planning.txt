Grid:
grid has various states and behaviours
it has rows and columns
it has CELL objects that we can find by indexing [row][column]
it is either 'in play' or over
there are just as many flags as there are CELLS with bombs

behaviours:
* initialises tiles/cells
* has to ensure first move is never a bomb because this ends game
* handles number of bombs and their location...
* handles flag limit and usage
* handles uncovering of cells
* can uncover multiple cells if a cell concealing a bomb has been uncovered



Cell/Tile:
it is either covered or uncovered
it has neighbours (all cells within a radius [the cell size], incl those at corners)
it is either a bomb/mine or a safezone
a safezone has personal safety that tells us about the safety of its neighbourhood

behaviours:
* you may only play covered tiles
covered tiles:
    * you can either place a flag on an covered tile that you strongly suspect to be concealing a mine
    * or you may dig to uncover it if you're certain it is a safezone
    * if you uncover a bomb, SEND MESSAGE to grid to uncover alles tiles and close grid
    * if you uncover a completely safezone, automatically uncover neighbours until until
uncovered tiles:
    * can show neighbour info
